## The Design of This Application

### What will this application do?
This application aims to create a cookbook, namely a collection of recipes, with detailed information for each of the
recipes, including 
1. name for the recipe
2. ingredients needed
3. style which this recipe belongs to (Western/Eastern)

Users,
once these *cookbooks* are made will have the liberty to add, track, delete recipes in their cookbooks
and may search recipes created by ingredients/style. Also,
the application grants the *rating ability* to users so that they can reflect their likings to the recipe by rating it
from 5 stars to one. 
### Who will use it?
The potential users of this application are the beginners cooks and home cooks who are not in particular familiar with recipes
and always in need of such an application installed to keep track of recipes while cooking or simply remind themselves of the ingredients needed
for a recipe while doing the grocery shopping for their families/restaurants.
### Why is this project of interest to you?
Because I myself am a beginner cook who is always struggling to buy correct/sufficient ingredients during grocery shopping for my
recipes and have difficulty from time to time to keep track the recipes I like by losing the website links for the recipes or just simply forget about them.
###User Story
1. As a user, I want to be able to add a recipe to my collection
2. As a user, I want to be able to view a list of the titles of the recipes in my collection
3. As a user, I want to be able to select a recipe in my collection and view the recipe in detail
4. As a user, I want to be able to select a recipe in my collection and rate it on a scale of one to five stars
5. As a user, I want to be able to view a list of the recipes with a given star numbers.
6. As a user, I want to be able to view a list of the recipes that use a specific ingredient. 
7. As a user, I want to be able to save my cookbook to file
8. As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my cookbook from file
9. "Phase 4: Task 2" Cookbook and Recipe classes are now with robust design.
